OVERVIEW
========

This repository contains `cryptmount`, a tiny utility that is a
wrapper for `cryptsetup` which makes use of a `crypttab` file.

This distribution is a fork of Sabotage-Linux' `cryptmount` as of
commit 8b7af97 (Thu Nov 19, 2020).  The Sabotage-Linux' version of
`cryptmount` is a patched version of Matthew's Monaco `cryptmount`.

This distribution have the following little differences:
  * add LICENSE file (taken from Matthew's initial Arch package)
  * GNU-style help/usage (`-[hV]` options)
  * no `awk(1)` dependency
  * `findmnt(8)` is mandatory
  * use `TMPDIR` as work directory and fallback to `/tmp` if unset
  * POSIX Makefile
  * various minor changes and cleanups (however, refactoring is still
    WIP)

See git log for complete/further differences.
