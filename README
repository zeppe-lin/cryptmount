OVERVIEW

	This directory contains cryptmount, a tiny utility that is a wrapper
	for cryptsetup which makes use of a crypttab file.

	This distribution is a fork of Sabotage-Linux' cryptmount as of commit
	8b7af97 (Thu Nov 19, 2020).  The Sabotage-Linux' version of cryptmount
	is a patched version of Matthew's Monaco cryptmount.

	This distribution have the following little differences:

		* add the LICENSE file (the license was obtained from git
		  history of Matthew's initial Arch Linux package)
		* the man pages have been rewritten in POD format and adjusted
		  for Zeppe-Lin

	See git log for complete/further differences.
