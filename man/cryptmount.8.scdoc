CRYPTMOUNT(8)

# NAME

cryptmount - parse crypttab for use by cryptsetup

# SYNOPSIS

*cryptmount* \
[*-Vfhnvq*] \
[*-c* _crypttab_] \
[*-w* _num_] \
[*-o* _options_] \
[*-O* _filters_] \
[{*-L* | *-M* [_name_ | _device_ | _name_ _device_ [_key_]] | \
*-U* [_name_[,...]]}]

# DESCRIPTION

The *cryptmount* utility uses *crypttab*(5) for calling *cryptsetup*(8);
it can also be used to define a _volume_ on the command line without
_crypttab_.

## Actions

*-L*
	List the _name_(s) (first column) of volumes from _crypttab_.
	Use with *-O* to manipulate which _name_(s) are listed.

*-M*
	Perform a mapping.  The first form of this command finds a
	volume from _crypttab_ either by its _name_ or _device_, or if
	nothing is given then map all volumes (use with *-O* to
	manipulate which volumes are mapped).  The second form defines
	a volume entirely on the command line, _crypttab_ is not used.

*-U*
	Unmap volume(s).  If a list of _name_(s) is given, unmap them.
	Otherwise unmap all volume(s) from _crypttab_ (with *-O* to
	manipulate which volume(s) are unmapped).

## Options

*-c* _crypttab_
	Specify an alternate configuration file instead of the default
	_/etc/crypttab_.

*-f*
	Force potentially destructive mappings.  For plain mappings
	(which are used with the *swap* and *tmp* options), there is a
	lot of potential to accidentally lose data.  Because of this,
	*cryptmount* performs a check with *blkid*(8) to see if there
	is anything identifiable on device.  Use *-f* to bypass this
	check.

*-w* _num_
	Time (in seconds) to wait for device if it is not already
	available.  If *udevd*(8) is not running, then *cryptmount*
	does not bother to wait and this option is a no-op.  This
	also affects the wait time for _keydevice_ if your key is a
	block device or a file on a block device.

*-n*
	Dry run, useful with *-v* to see how *cryptsetup*(8) will be
	called.

*-v*
	Increase verbosity.  This prints the commands which are being
	called (e.g., *cryptsetup*(8), *mkswap*(8), etc.).

*-q*
	Decrease verbosity.

*-o* _options_
	An options list with items such as *swap*, *cipher*, etc.
	This may be given multiple times with a cumulative effect.
	See *crypttab*(5) for the full options syntax.

*-O* _filters_
	Similar to _options_, this is used to manipulate which
	volume(s) are used with *-L* and with *-M*/*-U* without
	arguments.  If an option is present in filters, then the
	volume in _crypttab_ must contain the option.  For example
	*-O swap,size* matches all volume(s) with the *swap* option
	and any *size=size* option; or *-O swap,size=512* matches only
	those volume(s) with the *swap* option and specifically
	*size=512*.

	A filter option may also be negated by prefixing it with an
	exclamation  mark  ('*!*').  For example, *-O swap,!size*
	includes all volume(s) with the *swap* option but without the
	*size* option.  There is a built-in filter *!noauto*.

	Filters are especially useful with *%tag* options.  For example,
	*-O !%random* can be used to map all volumes which don't use
	*/dev/urandom* for a password and *-O %random* to map the
	remainder once your system's random seed has been restored.

	*Important*:
		The *-O* option has no effect when calling
		*cryptmount* in a way that does not use _crypttab_.

*-V*
	Print version and exit.

*-h*
	Print help and exit.
